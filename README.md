# Gift Shop

You will create a website for a Gift Shop. This website will have 3 types of users:

- Unregistered users. They can only see the content and add products to their shopping cart, but they can’t buy anything.

- Registered users. They can see the content, add products to their shopping cart and pay for the products (just a confirmation page, not a real payment system).

- Admin. They can do all the things that a registered user can do, but they can also create, delete and update products.

The website needs an index page where the products will be listed. The users will be able to select how many products they do want to be displayed per page, there will be a category filter to only display products from certain categories and a search form where the users will be able to search by product name (If a category is selected the search should be only for the products in the category).

Each product will have its own page where you will display all the product information and an “Add to cart” button, all items that a visitor user (not registered user), has on his shopping cart will be remembered by the application.

The section for adding, deleting and updating products needs to be only accessible by the users with the “Admin” role, if any user without that role tries to enter, they should be automatically redirected to the main page.

For this particular case you can add the Admin user directly in the database.

Feel free to add any improvement, for example, you can add a section of similar products that you may be interested in. Any improvement will be used for extra points.
